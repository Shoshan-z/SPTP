-fixed final for loop im main

-changed "spreadByDimArray" in find MaxSpread to a double array (coordinates are doubles)

-changed node->val = spPointGetAxisCoor((kdarr->points)[(kdarr->matrix)[splitDim][middle]], splitDim)
 to node->val = spPointGetAxisCoor((kdarr->points)[(kdarr->matrix)[splitDim][middle-1]], splitDim) 
 since kdArr->points starts with zero and middle is size and not index
